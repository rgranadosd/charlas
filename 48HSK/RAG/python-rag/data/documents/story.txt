This was Alex’s breakfast this morning:
Alex opted for a sweet and energy-rich breakfast. On his table there is a plate with assorted pastries: several croissants, a puff pastry cake, and two small rolled pastries dusted with powdered sugar. He paired this with a cup of coffee with milk and a glass of fresh orange juice. This type of breakfast provides quick energy from the carbohydrates in the pastries, along with vitamins from the juice and caffeine from the coffee.
This, on the other hand, was Rafa’s breakfast this morning:
Rafa chose a more savory, protein-rich breakfast. His plate includes an omelette, which appears to be made with eggs and possibly pieces of ham or bacon. As a side, there are pieces of potato and pepper, along with some roasted onion. He also has a glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee, which is already finished or almost empty. This breakfast offers a balanced combination of protein, vitamins, and energy.
